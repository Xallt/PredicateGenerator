Generator of logical expressions with the ability to translate them to a given *language*. 
This algorithm can be used to **generate methematical expressions**.\
*Pretty cool, right?*

1st place at **HSE CS project contest** among lyceum students.

It's a generator of logical expressions with the ability to translate them to a given *language*. 

### Examples

All the output is translated to LaTeX:

|     |     |     |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|*Basic*|*Mathematical*|*English*|
|[a](a)|||
<br>
Adjacent expressions are similar because the algorithm outputs the lines in lexigraphic order

Here are actually interesting generated "statements" (not all of them are true)
In this context variables are only non-negative integers

**1)** 2 is a prime number\
**2)** <del>Every single number is prime</del>\
**3)** Prime numbers exist **!**\
**5)** Every number is equal to itself\
**6)** There are numbers which are equal to themselves\
**7)** Not all numbers are prime\
**8)** <del>Prime numbers don't exist</del>\
